## Info

This game was made for the Completion Game Jam where the theme was "Out Of Place". We decided to incorporate this by having a paladin in a present day city fighting cops. There's also some chirpy tunes that do not feel like they are in the right game. The game is a top down wave based game where you fight to survive.
